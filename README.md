load plugins


```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

in vim mode 

```
:PlugInstall
```

reload and be happy without megaoverloaded IDE 

probably you need a little capacity to use only a keyboard for everything but this is cool :)
