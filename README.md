load plugins


```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

in vim mode 

```
:PlugInstall
```

reload and be happy without mega-overloaded IDE 

probably you need a little capacity to use only a keyboard for everything but this is cool :) 

super perfect if you have an old linux or darwin and you want to support a proj with 1kk lines of code without pretty Clion :)
